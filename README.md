# NASA-GeneLab--MicroArray-Codes
These rough R codes have been used to analyze transcriptomic and plant physiological data as part of the Gilroy NASA GeneLab program at the University of Madison-Wisconsin.
These codes are preliminary and we welcome collaboration in their development.
We aim to provide these codes to students, researchers and any citizen scientisit who is interested in using them.
